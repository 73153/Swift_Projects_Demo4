JustDeleteMe iOS
================

iOS App for JustDeleteMe (written in Swift)

Todo:

* Status bar is pushed against content
* Real logo (all white, just 'Delete' in red) in nav bar

The iOS8 extension should be named "Check Site", but the app name of "JustDeleteMe" is showing instead, which is slightly too long. This _is a known iOS bug_, should be fixed during later beta releases.

Extension is currently a 'Share' extension, instead of an 'Action' like it should be. If it's an Action, the extension takes up the entire screen, however with a Share extension we can have our Alert views overlay Safari.

Clicking 'Delete My Account' will open the delete page in Safari, or 'View in App' will search inside the app (pretty useless right now, but I wanted to try out a custom URL scheme):
