# Typhoon! (www.typhoonframework.org) 

Powerful dependency injection for Cocoa and CocoaTouch. Lightweight, yet full-featured and super-easy to use. 

## Familiar with Dependency Injection?

*Typhoon is a DI library that makes good use of the runtime's (ObjC or Swift) late binding nature in order to perform method interception and forwarding. This makes for a very compelling <a href="https://github.com/typhoon-framework/Typhoon#design-goals--features">feature list.</a>*

### What is Dependency Injection? 

Many people have trouble getting the hang of dependency injection, at first. And I think part of the problem is that
it is actually so simple that we're inclined to look for something more complicated. "Surely that there has to be
more to it?!", so to say.  

So, with that in mind, imagine that you're writing an app that gives weather reports. You need a cloud-service 
(excuse the pun ;) ) to provide the data, and at first you go for a free weather report provider, but in future you'd 
like to integrate a weather service with better accuracy and more features. So, as do all good object-oriented 
developers, you make a WeatherClient protocol and back it initially with an implementation based on the free, online
data provider. 

___Without dependency injection, you might have a View Controller like this___: 

```objective-c

- (id)init 
{
    self = [super init];
    if (self) 
    {
        //The class using some collaborating class builds its own assistant.
        //it might be one of several classes using the weatherClient. 
        _weatherClient = [[GoogleWeatherClientImpl alloc] initWithParameters:xyz];
    }
    return self;
}

```

The thing with this approach is, if you wanted to change to another weather client implementation you'd have to go
and find all the places in your code that use the old one, and move them over to the new one. Each time, making sure 
to pass in the correct initialization parameters. 

A very common approach is to have a centrally configured singleton:

```objective-c  
_weatherClient = [GoogleWeatherClient sharedInstance];
```  

With either of the above approaches, in order to test your view controller, you now have to test its collaborating 
class (the weather client) at the same time, and this can get tricky, especially as your application gets more 
complex. Imagine testing Class A, depends on Class B, depends on Class C, depends on .... Not much fun! 

_Sure, you could patch out the singleton with a mock or a stub, but this requires peeking inside the code to find the
dependencies. Besides taking time that could be better spent else-where, this ends up becoming "glass-box" testing as
opposed to "black-box" testing. Isn't it better to be able to test the external interface to a class, without having 
worry about what's going on inside? _And_ you have to remember un-patch again at the end of the test-case or risk 
strange breakages to other tests, where its difficult to pin-point what the real problem is might be._ . . 

. . . So with dependency injection, rather than having objects make their own collaborators, we have them supplied to the 
class instance via an initializer or property setter.

___And now, it simply becomes___: 

```objective-c

- (id)initWithWeatherClient:(id<WeatherClient>)weatherClient
{
    self = [super init];
    if (self) 
    {
        _weatherClient = weatherClient;
    }
    return self;
}

```


####Is that all they mean by 'injected'?

Yes it is. Right now, you might be thinking “Geez! That’s a pretty fancy name for something so plain.” Well, you‘d be right. But let‘s look at what happens when we start to apply this approach: Let's say you identify some hard-wired network configurations in a your GoogleWeatherClient, and correct this by instead passing them in via an initializer method. Now if you want to use this class, as a collaborator in a new class, let's say a ViewController, then your GoogleWeatherClient itself can be either a hard-wired dependency, or injected. To get the benefits of dependency injection again, we repeat the process, pulling up the class and along with its own dependencies. And we keep applying until we have a logical module or 'assembly'.

In this way dependency injection lets your application tell an architectural story. When the key actors are pulled up into an assembly that describes roles and collaborations, then the application’s configuration no longer exhibits fragmentation, duplication or tight-coupling. Having created this "script" that describes roles and collaborations we realize a number of benefits.

####Benefits of Dependency Injection

*    We can substitute another actor to fulfill a given role. If you want to change from one implementation to another, you need only change a single declaration.
*    By removing tight-coupling, we need not understand all of a problem at once, its easy to evolve our app’s design as the requirements evolve.
*    Classes are easier to test, because we can supply simple mocks and stubs in place of concrete collaborators. Or the real collaborators, but configured to be used in a test scenario.
*    It promotes separation of concerns and a clear contract between classes. Its easy to see what each class needs in order to do its job.
*    We can layout an app's architecture using stubs - the simplest possible implementation of a role - so that we can quickly see an end-to-end use-case taking place. Having done this, we can assign to other team members the responsibility of filling out these stubs for real implementations, and they can do so without breaking the app while they work, and without impacting other team members.


# Your Dependency Injection Options

If you proceed with the Dependency Injection pattern _(assuming you're not one of the remaining "flat-earthers", who 
believe that Objective-C somehow magically alleviates the need for common-sense: "Oh, I don't do DI, I use swizzling 
class-clusters!")_, then there are basically two options: 

* You can do dependency injection without a framework/library/container to help you. It ___is___ simple after all, and in 
fact I recommend you do this, at least as an exercise in software design. And yes, it is certainly possble that this will be 
adequate. ___But___, I think its good to have help, if you can get it. You can also write tests without a test 
framework, mocks with out a mock library, software without a compiler. 

* So, going down the library/framework route, there's been quite a lot of action in Objective-C land, over the last 
three years. In fact, there are now around 15 Dependency Injection frameworks, many following in the footsteps of Google Guice. 
The authors have done a great job (Objection is especially good). However, I wanted an approach that allows the 
following: 

## Design Goals / Features

* Non-invasive. ***No macros or XML required*** . . . Uses <a href="https://github.com/typhoon-framework/Typhoon/wiki/Quick-Start">powerful Objective-C runtime approach.</a>

* Its not necessary to change ***any*** of your classes to use the framework. ***Can be introduced into legacy applications.***

* No magic strings - ***supports IDE refactoring, code-completion and compile-time checking.*** 

* Provides ***full-modularization and encapsulation of configuration*** - grouping the application assembly 
details into a single document, with chapters. ***Let your architecture tell a story.*** 

* ***Dependencies declared in any order.*** (The order that makes sense to humans).

* Makes it easy to have multiple configurations of the same base-class or protocol. 

* Allows both dependency injection (injection of classes defined in the DI context) as well as configuration 
 management (values that get converted to the required type at runtime). Because this allows. . . 
 
* . . . ability to configure components for use in eg ___Test___ vs ___Production___ scenarios. This faciliates a 
good compromise between integration testing and pure unit testing. (Biggest testing bang-for-your-buck). 

* Supports ***injection of view controllers*** and ***storyboard integration.*** 

* Supports both ***initializer***, ***property*** and ***method injection***. For the latter two, it has customizable call-backs to ensure that the class is in the required state before and after injection. 

* Supports a mixture of static dependencies along with <a href="https://github.com/typhoon-framework/Typhoon/wiki/Types-of-Injections#injection-with-run-time-arguments">run-time arguments</a> to create factories on the fly. This greatly reduces the amount of boiler-plate code that you would normally write. 

* Excellent ***support for circular dependencies.***

* ***Powerful memory management features***. Provides pre-configured objects, without the memory overhead of singletons.

* ***Lightweight***. It has a very low footprint, so is appropriate for CPU and memory constrained devices. Weighs in at just 2500 lines of code in total! 

* ***Battle-tested*** - used in all kinds of Appstore-featured apps.
