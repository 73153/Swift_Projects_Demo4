CF Monit
========

A simple iOS application to monitor apps on Cloud Foundry

- Uses the new Swift iOS language
- Uses the CF CC APIs to login and access application state

Limited to read-only data. Does not allow user to perform any actions at this point

I welcome any and all feedback: maximilien at the ACM.org domain
