# Swift Sorts

A collection of [sorting algorithms](http://xkcd.com/1185/) implemented in Swift.

**See [Objective-C Sorts](https://github.com/jessesquires/objc-sorts) for comparison!**

Each sorting algorithm is executed on a list of 10,000 randomly generated numbers and verified.

Execution time for each algorithm is logged for comparison.

## Algorithms

* Swift `Array.sort()`
* [Quick Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort)
* [Heap Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heapsort)
* [Insertion Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insertion_sort)
* [Selection Sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort)

## Use

Open in Xcode, build and run.
